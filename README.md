## How to use

## Cipher Logic
- **Substitution Cipher**: Maps alphanumeric characters (0-9, A-Z) to 36 specific Unicode characters that look like **6** or **7**.
- **Character Set**: Uses exactly 18 variants of "6" and 18 variants of "7".
- **Case Insensitive**: 'A' and 'a' map to the same symbol.
- **Preserves**: Spaces, punctuation, and special characters are kept as is.
- **Visuals**: The output looks like a mix of 6s and 7s.
